# Deep Learning Projects Repo

This repository contains material from completed Deep Learning Projects from the various courses Ahmad Rajab as done with Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program, Fast.ai's [Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai) program and other Deep Learning Projects. It consists of a bunch of Deep Learning code notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs.
